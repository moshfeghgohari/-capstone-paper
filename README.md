Title: Usability evaluation in Holographic Augmented Reality applications


BIOGRAPHY:
I am MARJAN MOSHFEGH GOHARI, a master's Student at the northeastern university and very close to be graduated. 
My two major interests and passions always were Computing and psychology, and four years ago, I found 
Human-Computer Interaction as a creative fusion between these disciplines. I tried to take some courses and then start a job in this area. 
Fortunately, I had a chance to work as a UX designer in one of the best Health-related companies for three years.
Then I decided to polish my experience with broader knowledge in computer science, Choosing most of my projects in the HCI area.
What I hoped to get out of the program was basically a different perspective to discover problems that need attention.
Therefore, I wanted to learn how research is conducted and, from that, design a solution.
I connect deeply with the problem I am working on, and I am grateful to have a very supportive supervisor.


ABSTRACT:

Augmented Reality is the recent media that is enabling special human-computer interaction experiences. The interactive 3D holographic system is an AR technology that provides users with a hybrid visual experience in which 3D Hologram becomes a part of the real world.
As AR applications are relatively novel, most targeted users are novices. Hence, for these users, several actions in the AR apps can be confusing, and they might find it difficult to use them. Moreover, as we move forward with AR technology, understanding how users interact with the holograms is essential.
Therefore, usability evaluation plays a crucial role in accepting this kind of application by the targeted group. Since most relevant studies have focused on technological developments and usability of holographic AR applications has not been discussed frequently in the literature, there is a need to explore their usability problems and define user experience guidelines. Usability testing is considered a central phase of User Experience (UX) research and consists of verifying three main variables used to measure usability (efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction). This study aims to evaluate the Usability factors and explore usability issues in Holographic Augmented Reality (AR) applications using HoloX as a pilot. This study conducted four usability evaluation methods to obtain the more accurate result: cognitive, walk-through, heuristic evaluation, laboratory observation and questionnaire.
 We have collected qualitative and quantitative data during this process and analyzed and interpreted the collected data, aligning with end-users ' needs and requirements.
The outcome obtained from the four usability methods has been represented in this document. Also, a set of design guidelines for AR applications has been proposed. This research also will provide guidance on: What types of data should be collected and how that data can be analyzed.
